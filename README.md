# Week-Three-LongList-Project

#README FILE#

I created a Long List Task Organizer. The user was able to add tasks,view list, and mark as complete or "do later". The list can be saved and loaded.

**Time Management**

Time management was the biggest challenge of this project. I used a series of TODO notes in Github to track my progress. I was not able to accurately access the amount of time required for each task. According to my estimations it should have taken me around 15 hours. The actual number was between 24 & 25. 

My program met all of the core requirements, so my next steps would be to fix the error of when the user hit 'previous' or 'next' buttons at the wrong place. After that
I would clean up the UI and make it a bit more robust and visually friendly.
